# Craps-Game
On a Come Out roll the Come Bet is placed on the pass line as they are an identical bet. After you place your bet the first dice roll will set the come point. You win if it is a natural (7, 11) and lose if it is craps (2, 3, 12). Other rolls will make you a winner if the come point is repeated before a 7 is rolled.
